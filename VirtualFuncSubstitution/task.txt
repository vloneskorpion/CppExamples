We want to monitor some set of devices on same network that we are on
-> Each device type is unique in how we must interact with it
-> It is not possible to know the device's connection information before we join the network - we must find it in-situ

Design considerations

Device detection
-> Easiest to ﬁnd all devices of a single type at once
-> One scan per device type 

Device state monitoring
-> Need to allow each device type to have diﬀerent communication mechanisms
-> Want to update state only on-command to avoid network overhead
